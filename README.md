# Car-Detection by Raspberry Pi
A minute part of the prototype for smart car parking through raspberry pi this repository verifies the captured image consist of a car or not. If the image has a car it glows a green LED otherwise it turns on the red LED.


### Prerequisites

###### Hardware:

1. Raspberry Pi 3/2 not zero(no official TensorFlow installation is provided)
2. Raspberry Pi Camera Module
3. One Micro SD-Card
4. One Breadboard
5. One push button
6. One RED LED
7. One GREEN LED
8.Three 330â„¦ resistor's and some jumper cables


###### Softwares:
1. RASPBIAN STRETCH or RASPBIAN STRETCH LITE OS
2. Etcher
3. SD-Card Formatter


###### Libraries on Pi:
1. Python 2.7 (Defaultly installed on Pi OS )
2. PIP
3. RPi.GPIO
4. picamera
5. TensorFlow Module

### Installing

- First download raspbian stretch or raspbian stretch lite operating system image and burn to SD-Card using etcher tool and follow the below link to setup raspberry pi in a headless mode to perform SSH operations on it.
